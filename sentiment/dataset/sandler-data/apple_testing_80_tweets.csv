Hey @apple, if you send me a free iPhone (any version will do), I will publicly and ceremoniously burn my #BlackBerry.

Love ios5 Easter eggs. Pull down from middle top to bottom and see what pulls down. Awesome little feature! #ios5 @apple
Gone for a run, beautiful morning , man do I love iOS 5 @apple, #iPhone
@apple your simply the best.
I must admit @apple has made me a very happy camper! I have text tones now! Lol! Ring tone: #MakeMeProud Drakes vers! Text tone: Nicki's
@alexlindsay My wife upgraded her iPhone 4. I think Siri alone is worth the upgrade. Looking forward to @Apple continuing to enhance Siri.
@apple Siri is amazing
just my man @apple store in @schaumburg, whoops!!!!üòÅ

@Apple's Siri is witchcraft.  What's next @googleresearch. 2 yr lead lost?
Thank you @apple for making my iPad 2 feel like new again with your new iOS 5!
dammit, listening to siri is making me want to upgrade. well played @apple.
Create new folders from within your photo album in #iOS5, finally!! Thanks @Apple, that's been a thorn in my side for a while. #newfeature
RT @To1ne: .@apple thanks for fixing this... http://t.co/wTj1ogDO
I am crazy about #iOS5 . The photo cropping is the best! @apple
RT @SawyerHartman: I FU*KING LOVE YOU @APPLE this phone is the best thing ever !! SIRI = BEST THING EVER MADE
The #iphone4s is  amazing. Siri's voice recognition is absolutely a step above previous attempts. Bravo @apple
THiS IS WHAT WiLL KiLL APPLE http://t.co/72Jw4z5c RiP @APPLE
Why is  #Siri always down @apple
I just need to exchange a cord at the apple store why do I have to wait for a genius? @apple
Oh, @apple. Steve obviously had nothing to do with iPhoto, as it's the perfect opposite of 'insanely great'. Get it fixed, please.
Boy, could @apple make it any harder to put my purchased music from the cloud on to my new macbook pro? "You must authorize this computer‚Ä¶"
. @apple & @AT&T u cannot tell me there isn't at least 1 64GB iPhone 4S in LA or Vegas!! Give me a fucking break!!!!
Love @apple downloads. 4 hours and i-pad now wonky! #ripstevejobs #thenonsensepersists #neednewipadguide #fatfuckingchance
It would be great If @Apple would send my new phone. #frustrated
So apparently @apple put MB cap on your SMS with the new update. 25mb storage before it tells you your inbox is full. What is this 2001?
You know @apple It's been almost a week since I paid for iTunes Match, I would really like to use it. Any ETA on a fix?
What??? I that sucks hello @apple RT @PhoneDog_Aaron Interesting note - DROID RAZR's battery isn't removable.
@bisquiat @Apple the upgrade just slows down my phone so much, it's stuck half the time. uch. thankfully no other damage. sucks for you :(
@Mayati I think @Apple didn't do such a thorough job with the step x steps for upgrade and move to iCloud. Now it's cost me mightily.
Correction: @ Best Buy kudos to Chris @ Alamo Ranch S.A. TX-fixed issues couldn't resolve after 1/2 day w/ @ATT & @Apple. Hero of my day!
Would it kill @apple to put a braille type bump on their earbuds so we know which bud is R and L in the dark.
WTF?!?! @apple the new iOS 5 doesn't allow you NOT to get push notifications from newstand? and SIRI just keeps yapping FUCK!
@Apple, on the #iPad with #iOS5, why has the Messages Icon been included when it can't be used?
@apple why is my iPhone battery so crappy #fail
Why doesn't @apple iCloud sync Stickies? They've always been around, just nothing every progressed w/ them!! Why apple why?  @gruber
@apple $319 to repair my iPad 2, Apple you've lost me and my $700 a year, Android here I come!
iMessage doesn't show the time a message was sent, annoying @apple
@albertmal88 remember @apple is evil. #icloud entering the #dropbox market
ugh! @apple, you‚Äôre reservation page for the iPhone is NOT working.
iTunes is @apple's worst product. Worse than the #Newton or the hockey puck mouse. It's utterly painful to use.
i update to ios 5 and lose everything on my phone and it wont let me sign into my itunes account... thanks @Apple
none of my apps work after the new ios from @apple. what do i do?!?
Seemingly endless loop of calls to @apple, @ups, @verizonwireless to investigate my missing #iphone4s. #crankywithnophone

Where is my iPhone!?!?!?! @apple
An apple update has seemed to render my work machine incapable of opening HDV video. Thanks @Apple. Zero useful productivity today.
Can someone plz explain to me whhyy @apple is only distributing 2-3 phones per day to the sprint stores. I'm really ... http://t.co/uf9taK8f
‚Äú@carlton858: I really hate dealing with the brain dead people at the @apple store. For such good products, customer service sucks.‚Äù in NZ?
You can make photo albums in the Photos app with iOS 5, but can't password protect them? Um... @apple, fix that. Quickly.

‚Äú@philipgrey: dear @apple, why you gotta go change the way &lt;input type="number"&gt; is handled out of the blue?‚Äù
@apple: Multiple times siri is "having trouble connecting to the network."  Siri needs servers (and some exercise!)
any chance @apple will release good headphones that dont blast music outside the ears? #iphone #ipod its quite obnoxious
@trisha_ps @iCloud is Cloudy. @apple tech, not very techy.
This. RT @bonkoif Looks like @Apple did not appropriately project the resources needed for Siri. Not very reliable
Spoke to an @Apple rep on phone & could hear her tv blaring in the bg.  She said, "I can't actually help u, just direct u back to the web"
@samsung, @apple, you do realise you're just really pissing off the customer base AS WELL AS looking petty.
Just searching with my voice on my 2 year old nexus one @apple.
@apple, your update server has been timing out for a week. i had to force a restore w/the new #iOS5 software. lost all my stuff. thanks!
#appleupdates 2 success stories- iPhone & iPad 2. Now been on phone to Apple 45 mins. iPad 1 WILL not. Wasting my time @apple #Replaceit!
Pondering the iOS update... From the sounds of @MikeFerri's difficulties, I may just hold off :/ @Apple, FIX IT!
@Apple, #iOS5 #geolocation Suburbs with 2 words drops Map Pins in other States! Please fix.
Sorry @apple, but #iMessage will never be what #BBM is. Disappointed.

#ios5 getting sloppy @apple. U need to check your QA team. Too many issues with apps, data and syncing
not happy with @apple right now. the upgrade to my itouch4 took out my itouch and laptop. #help
@apple What's the point of iCloud wireless updates when ios5 now forces me to use the computer to charge my ipod touch now? #worstupdateever
Smashed yet another #iPhone screen. When are @apple gonna make the phone more durable!!! Tired of fixing it myself!!!
Life was much easier when @apple and @BlackBerry were just fruits!
@apple pls launch #Siri on iphone4 .. Disappointed after spending hours for upgrading to iOS5..
The new iOS5 completely failed at upgrading the phone. Now I'm stuck in this restore loop. Thanks @apple for wasting my day. Can i undo?
@Blackberry does take better quality photos than @Apple iPhone though. I give them that! #photograhersEye
I will never purchase another @Apple product for the rest of my life. I am glad Steve Jobs is fucking dead. MAY YOU FUCKING ROT IN HELL!!!!!
yo, @apple, this update is a disaster
RT @JoelBurns: Dear @Apple, it's me again. Thank for beautiful new iOS features. But I miss some of the old ones. Lk making calls & texts &gt;(
‚Ä¶and only the first 23 images in my Photo Roll made it over? Seriously, @apple, how did you fuck this up so much?
Now @apple won't let me use credit on @iTunes unless I have a credit card. Should have told me when I redeemed the cards. Sound fair to you?
has been on terminal hold with @apple support!  She must not be the only person having trouble with the new iphone and synching!
90 minutes after being at 100% my iPhone 4 (post #ios5 upgrade) has lost 40% of its charge and the @apple store folks are out of ideas.
So "cutting the cord" makes podcasts even harder to manage?!? No subscriptions! WTH, @Apple? http://t.co/LD2i871x #iOS5 (via @carrypad)
